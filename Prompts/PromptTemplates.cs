            Create chapter markers for this podcast episode from the timestamped transcript below.
            {{contextSection}}
            Each line shows a time range followed by the speaker and text for that segment.
            Identify where MAJOR topic shifts occur and create chapters at those points.

            IMPORTANT: Be VERY selective - only create chapters for significant topic changes.
            Think of chapters as major sections viewers would skip to, not every minor topic.

            Guidelines:
            - Create approximately {{targetChapters}} chapters (minimum {{settings.MinChapters}}, maximum {{settings.MaxChapters}})
            - Only mark MAJOR topic transitions - ignore minor shifts
            - Each chapter should represent 5-10+ minutes of distinct content
            - First chapter MUST start at 00:00 (Introduction/Opening)
            - For each chapter, use the START timestamp from where the topic begins
            - Format timestamps as MM:SS or HH:MM:SS
            - Episode duration is about {{(int)durationSeconds}} seconds; do not emit timestamps beyond that
            - Distribute chapters evenly; avoid any gap > 10 minutes between chapters
            - Create descriptive titles (under {{settings.ChapterTitleMaxWords}} words)

            Return chapters in this EXACT format, one per line:
            MM:SS Title Here
            or
            HH:MM:SS Title Here

            Do not include any other text, numbering, or commentary.
