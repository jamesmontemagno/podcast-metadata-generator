## Style Guidelines

### C# Style

- Use C# 12+ features where appropriate
- Follow [Microsoft's C# coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use nullable reference types (`#nullable enable`)
- Prefer `var` when the type is obvious
- Use expression-bodied members for simple getters/methods
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs when relevant

### Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Parses a transcript file and returns structured segments.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="filePath">Path to the transcript file.</param>
/// <returns>A parsed transcript with segments.</returns>
public async Task<Transcript> ParseAsync(string filePath)
{
    // Implementation
}
```
